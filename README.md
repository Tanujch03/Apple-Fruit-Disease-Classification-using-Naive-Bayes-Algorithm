Apples are one of the most productive varieties of fruit in the world, with a high 
nutritional and medicinal value. However, numerous diseases affect apple production 
on a wide scale, resulting in significant economic losses. These diseases often go 
overlooked until just before, after, or after fruit has been processed. Many pathogens 
can be avoided with cultural traditions and (optional) fungicides, even if there are no 
cures for tainted fruit. However, accurate diagnosis is essential for determining the 
right management practices and preventing further losses. Apple scab, apple rot, and 
apple blotch are some of the most prevalent diseases that affect apples. 
The proposed approach will greatly aid in the automated identification and 
classification of apple diseases, according to our test results. We discovered that 
normal apples were easy to discern from diseased apples in our trial, and by 
implementing the naïve bayes algorithm with a classification accuracy of more than 
70.83333333333334 percent.
